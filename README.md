My name is Alperen Karslıoğlu and I am 19 years old, second year undergraduate, studying at
Bilkent University Computer Science department. I am passionate of serving my country and the
humanity, and I believe in that we design and code the future. So that, as long as we keep working
hard, we will win the future.
